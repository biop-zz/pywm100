PYWM100

pywm100 can retrieve data store on heart bit rate logger devices from Oregon Scientific or equivalent like Kalenji PC cardio Connect. It has been tested under Linux and based on Python.
You can output data in fitlog format or hrm format using command line options

You need to put both files in a directory, python 2.7, pyusb module. A data directory will be created in the current one to receive output files.

For unprivileged access of usb, you may need following modification (on a fedora 14)

ATTRS{idVendor}=="0fde", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0105", MODE="666"
